      <h3>ABOUT MIRACLE BIRTHDAYS&nbsp;</h3>
      <p> A birthday is a day that only comes once a year for every single person. This day is an anniversary of the day an individual come into the world, which makes it such a special day. In different cultures, beliefs, and families, birthdays are celebrated in some special ways. <img src="birthdaycakesmall.jpeg" alt="Birthday Cake" width="200" height="200" class="left_float"/></p>
      <p>Miracle Birthday was found by a group of young college students who have had a lot of experience working with childre. This group of 4 students used to raise money for families in poverty and hosted many different mission trips. They have dedicated their mission specifically for children. <br><br> The purpose of Miracle Birthdays is to create memorable birthdays for children up to the age of 10, who come from low income families or  under special circumstances. Many of these children may never had a chance to have a birthday celebration of their dream. We work with elementary schools in California to recieve birthday requests from teachers. We spread birthday cheer 365 days a year. <br> We are trying to spread this miracle to children from other places around the United States, as well as around the world if requested. Miracle Birthdays enriches the lives of the children we serve by making sure they are remembered on their special day.</p>

      <p>Birthday celebrations are great ways to bond with family and friends. Birthday presents are good, but a wish that comes from the heart is worth all the presents in this world from those who love you. It truly is the thought that counts. By helping these children to make their birthday happens, we wish them all the best in their life. </p>

      <p class="column_text">We partner with local businesses for our birthday supplies. Our fund mainly comes from our donors, who would like to contirbue some monetary value to kids' birthday parties. <br><br> We have volunteers who help with planning, decorating, and shipping.
