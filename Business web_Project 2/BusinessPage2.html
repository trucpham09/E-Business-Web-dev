      <h2 class="column_title">BIRTHDAYS ON THE BREADLINE</h2>
      <p class="column_text"> Over half of parents in lower-income groups cannot afford to organise birthday parties for their children, according to the findings of a new survey from Povery and Social Exclusion.<br><br>
      Today, nearly one in four children in the U.S. live at or below the poverty line. Children living in poverty often go without the everyday items that we take for granted. Special milestones, like birthdays, are often overlooked because of their families’ personal/financial circumstances. <br><br>The children and families we serve are all dealing with difficult life situations — but one thing is common: their need for happiness, cheer, and hope. Miracle Birthdays programming allows these families a "cognitive gift", a chance to take a break from their stress and to have a moment of normalcy.<br></p>
