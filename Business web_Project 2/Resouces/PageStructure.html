				<p> About&nbsp; </p>
				<p> Over half of parents in lower-income groups cannot afford to organise birthday parties for their children, according to the findings of a new survey from Povery and Social Exclusion.&nbsp;</p>

				<p> Miracle Birthdays&nbsp; is to bring JOY to children experiencing homelessness through the MAGIC of a birthday party! With the help of our birthday enthusiasts (volunteers), we host monthly birthday bashes at homeless and transitional living facilities across the country. Our themed parties are complete with activities and games, decorations, cakes, and FUN for all the children and families living at the agency.&nbsp;</p>

				<p> &nbsp;When you give, you’re giving more than a birthday party - you’re giving hope and encouragement to the children who need it most.</p>

				<p> Our hope is that every child, despite their living conditions, can feel celebrated on their birthday! When you sponsor a Birthday Box&nbsp; , we will deliver it to foster care communities and child protective services so that kids can still experience the power of a celebration!</p>
				
				<p> Each box provides case managers with all the supplies necessary to throw a rockin' party for their kiddos! This box is meant to be a fun keepsake for the birthday child!</p>
