      <h3>ABOUT MIRACLE BIRTHDAYS</h3>
      <p>A birthday is a day that only comes once a year for every single person. This day is an anniversary of the day an individual come into the world, which makes it such a special day. In different cultures, beliefs, and families, birthdays are celebrated in some special ways.  <img src="../birthdaycakesmall.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="200" class="left_float"/>ex ea commodo consequat.

      <p> The purpose of Miracle Birthdays is to create memorable birthdays for children up to the age of 10, who come from low income families or  under special circumstances. Many of these children may never had a chance to have a birthday celebration of their dream. We work with elementary schools in California to recieve birthday requests from teachers. We are trying to spread this miracle to children from other places around the United States, as well as around the world if requested.</p>

      <p>Birthday celebrations are great ways to bond with family and friends. Birthday presents are good, but a wish that comes from the heart is worth all the presents in this world from those who love you. It truly is the thought that counts. By helping these children to make their birthday happens, we wish them all the best in their life.</p>

      <p class="column_text">We partner with local businesses for our birthday supplies. Our fund mainly comes from our donors, who would like to contirbue some monetary value to kids' birthday parties. We have volunteers who help with planning, decorating, and shipping. Our volunteers come to the birthday party location to set up the party. If a child's family would like privacy, or would like to work together among family members, we will provide them with a fund.</p>
